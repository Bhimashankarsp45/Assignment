This Java program uses Selenium WebDriver to interact with the OWASP Juice Shops login form and attempts a controlled SQL injection attack to test for vulnerabilities.
Requirements
Java JDK
Selenium WebDriver library
ChromeDriver
OWASP Juice Shop application
Setup
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Add Selenium WebDriver to your projects dependencies.
3. Download and configure ChromeDriver to match your browser version.
Running the Program
1. Run the Java program using your IDE or command line.
2. The program will open a Chrome browser, navigate to the Juice Shop login page, and attempt the SQL injection.
3. The results will be printed to the console, indicating whether a SQL injection vulnerability was detected.
Exception Handling
The program uses a try-catch-finally block to handle exceptions.
If an element is not found or the test encounters an issue, the exception is caught, and the stack trace is printed for debugging purposes.
The browser is closed in the finally block to ensure cleanup.
Assumptions
The test assumes that the Juice Shop application is running and accessible.
The ChromeDriver executable is correctly configured in the system path.
